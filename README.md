# python_for_data_science_piscine

This repo contains the modules and exercises that I've completed that touches on Python basics as well as tools that are used in conjunction with Python for data science.

Since it was my first time really getting into Python, it took quite awhile for me to get used to the simplified and the object-oriented syntax especially as a programmer with a C background.

However, after completing these modules, I can see why so many people use and like Python now. :)

# Modules:
1. Module 0: Starting
```
Learnt:
- basic Python data structures: tuples, dictionary, sets...
- Python data types: None, object..
- Try-exception error handling
- main functions, program + arguments handling with sys
- list comprehensions, lambdas, generator functions with the keyword yield
- function __doc__
- basic package creation
```

2. Module 1: Array
```
Learnt:
- basics of Numpy, array manipulation methods
- Pillow library: image loading, image manipulation (color, size, rotation...)
- how changing the RGB values of pixels gives different image effects (inverted, greyscale...)
```

3. Module 2: Data Table
```
Learnt:
- what CSV files are
- basic Pandas: loading csv files
- basic Matplotlib: graph plotting functions
- graph plotting: log scale, line graphs, scatter plots
```

4. Module 3: OOP (Object oriented programming)
```
Learnt:
- OOP syntax: classes, __init__, static methods, class methods, instance methods
- OOP concepts: abstract classes and methods, inheritance, multiple inheritance, Diamond Inheritance, mro (method resolution order)
```

5. Module 4: DOD (Data oriented design)
```
Learnt:
- function wrappers, decorators, function nesting
- the dataclass decorator (for simpler class creation
```
